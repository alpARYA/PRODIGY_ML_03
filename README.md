# Cat vs Dog Image Classifier
This project implements a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to classify images of cats and dogs. The model is trained on a subset of the Kaggle dataset "Dogs vs. Cats" due to hardware limitations, and a simple graphical user interface (GUI) is built using the Gradio library to allow for easy testing of the model.
